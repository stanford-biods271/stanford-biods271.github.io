    "content": "Course Description . Generative AI and large-scale self-supervised foundation models are poised to have a profound impact on human decision making across occupations. Healthcare is one such area where such models have the capacity to impact patients, clinicians, and other care providers. In this course, we will explore the training, evaluation, and deployment of generative AI and foundation models, with a focus on addressing current and future medical needs. The course will cover models used in natural language processing, computer vision, and multi-modal applications. We will explore the intersection of models trained on non-healthcare domains and their adaptation to domain-specific problems, as well as healthcare-specific foundation models. Prerequisites . Familiarity with machine learning principles at the level of CS 229, 231N, or 224N . Time &amp; Location . Mon, Wed 3:00 PM - 4:20 PM at Alway Building, Room M112 . Instructors . Akshay Chaudhari . akshaysc@stanford.edu . Office Hours Coming soon! . James Zou . jamesz@stanford.edu . Office Hours Coming soon! . Tanveer Syeda-Mahmood . stf@us.ibm.com . Office Hours Coming soon! . TAs . Maya Varma . mvarma2@stanford.edu . Office Hours Coming soon! . Coursework . Coursework will be divided into the following categories: . | Class Participation (10%): Students are encouraged to attend lectures and participate actively by asking questions and offering comments. | Homework Assignments (30%): This course will include two homework assignments. Additional details coming soon. | Final Project (60%): Students will form teams and choose from one of the suggested projects or select their own project. Teams are expected to work on the research project throughout the second half of the quarter and produce conference-style papers. Each team will present the paper to the entire class at the end of the semester. Additional details coming soon. | . ",
